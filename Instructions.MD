<h3>The application’s Server should:</h3>

<ul>
Utilize a Node / Express server.
Contain an array of strings.
Have one endpoint to fetch all strings.
Have one endpoint to prepend a new string to the array.
</ul>

<h3>The application’s Client should:</h3>

<ul>
Have one page to display all strings stored on server.
Have one page with UI to input a string and send to server.
Allow a user to navigate between the two pages.
Not be fully styled, but should be laid out in a meaningful way.
</ul>

<h3>The application must leverage:</h3>

<ul>
React Router
Redux
Redux Saga
Reselect
Styled Components - Use at least one styled component. The component must have a prop passed into the Styled Component for conditional rendering.
Unit Tests - Write tests for one container. (Full test coverage is not required.)
</ul>

<h3>Helpful Tips:</h3>

<ul>
Focus on developing for the worst-case scenario, not the best-case.
Be sure to give the user as much visual feedback as possible, for example showing a loading indicator while data is being retrieved.
No need to setup a database or persist data.
No need to deploy the application.
</ul>
